> Anatomy of a Data Product

> A data product is an application or tool that uses data to help businesses/users improve their decisions. Data products provide the user easy, non-technical access to Data science methodologies – meaning it can abstract the complications of data science to provide a concrete output to the users to make decisions that are critical to their work.

> Types of Data Products
Data products themselves can be classified under two categories:

> Decision Supporting
Products of this type are mostly used to derive insights from the underlying data. They can either:
Provide raw data access
Where the user processes the data on their end to generate insights. Think of database access tools like DBeaver, MySQL Workbench, etc.
Provide derived data access
Where a large portion of the data is cleaned up, and the user has access to only the cleaned-up data points. Advanced Analytics run on that data can also feature in the data points available. Tools like Tableau, PowerBI, StreamLabs, Plotly Dash, etc. fall under this category. They mostly are visualization tools with an ability to process data at their end OR allow the user to process some data through complex queries.

> Automated Decision-Making
Products under this type take decisions on behalf of the user. Almost always, there is a Data science element involved. Here, the users’ role is only in monitoring and tweaking the outputs from the machine. Recommender systems, workforce planning systems are typical examples of these types of products.
There are many tools that are hybrids: Google Analytics with Google Ads can provide an easy way to analyze the user journey and, at the same, provide segments to target through Google Ads.
