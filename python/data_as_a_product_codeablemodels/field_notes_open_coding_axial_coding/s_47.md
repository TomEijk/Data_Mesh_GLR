> Data Mesh / Data Product Security Pattern

> Data Mesh / Data Product Security Pattern
Data is the foundational building block of a modern enterprise. But far too often we see headlines highlighting the catastrophic consequences caused by gaps in security practices. These security gaps come in many flavours from leaky perimeters to errant employees and everything in between.
Data security is the practice of addressing these gaps to protect digital information from unauthorized access, corruption, or theft throughout its entire lifecycle. Data Mesh offers a unique opportunity to protect data.
This article will explore how the Data Mesh / Data Product Security Pattern:
Secures boundaries for Data Products, the architecture quantum of Data Mesh.
Provides granular security for data inside Data Products.
Ensures communication between Data Products in an enterprise Data Mesh are safe, secure, and monitored.
Architects a secure run-time environment for each Data product in an enterprise Data Mesh.
Transforms security violations into consistently formatted and well defined “security events”.
Integrates into an enterprise security regime by publishes security events to enterprise operational and security management tools.
This article assumes that you have a high-level understanding of Data Mesh. If you need some background information on Data Mesh, there are a number of great articles are available here (patterns), here (architecture), here (principles) and here (lessons learned). For interested readers, a full set of Data Mesh patterns are available here and here.

> Pattern Summary
Data Mesh offers unique opportunities to protect data. First, it provides Data Products which offer well-defined data boundaries where security can be applied. Second, these Data Products have owners which ensure there is clear accountability and responsibility for the security of data within the domain. Third, Data Mesh offers a self-service access model which provides clear contracts that describes how data is consumed who can, or tries, to consume it. And, lastly, it offers a federated governance approach that facilitates monitoring data security.
The Data Mesh / Data Product Security Pattern illustrates a consistent method to apply security for an Enterprise Data Mesh and the Data Products that it manages.

> Context and Business Problem
Safety and security of an enterprise data is built upon a foundation of security policies implemented in data products and data mesh components. Today, these policies vary by:
Product (for example, Oracle vs SQL Server)
Run-time environment (for example, AWS vs Google)
Location (for example, Data Center vs Cloud)
So, it is not surprising that data and security professions lack crucial information about their Data Mesh operational, security, and governance characteristics, including:
Unclear Access Rights, making it difficult to understand the credentials, roles, and/or permissions required to consume data.
Inconsistent Security Policies, making it costly to adhere to regulatory and privacy requirements for data.
Lack of Usage Information, making it difficult to govern access rights to sensitive data.
Delays in Surfacing Security Violations, causing delays in addressing security issues.
Gaps in Security Context, making it difficult and time consuming to diagnosis security violations.
The Data Mesh / Data Product Security Pattern addresses each of these issues.

> Solution
Recognizing Data Products are the architecture “quantum” of a Data Mesh (ie. a Data Mesh is an amalgam of multiple data products), Data Mesh / Data Product Security Pattern defines access security controls points for Data Products:
At the perimeter of Data Products,
Within Data Products, and,
Between Data Products.

> At the perimeter of Data Products, this pattern recognizes the following security policies:
Run-time Environment Security: While these policies are heavily dependent upon the run-time environment for the Data Product, several of the many vendors offer security for containers (Docker), pods (Kubernetes), VMs, across on-premises and cloud environments.
API Access Control: OpenAPI specifications, the most popular API contract definition, allows security schemas and “scopes” (use with OAUTH2) to be defined which dictate credentials to access a Data Product.
Within Data Products, this pattern recognizes several security policies:
Role-Based Access Control: Access to Data Products may be limited to those that have a particular role or group.
Row-Based Access Control: Security policies allow individual rows are protected; This may be important where elevated privileges are required to access subsets of a given table within a Data Product.
Attribute-Based Access Control: Security policies allow individual columns to be protected; Elevated privileges may be required to access sensitive fields within a Data Product.
Data Encryption and Tokenization: Data at-rest is encrypted or tokenized based upon the sensitivity of the data within a Data Product.

        attribute_based_access_control, 
        encryption
    '''
```

>Between Data Products, this pattern recognizes the following security policies:
General Network Security Controls: these are policies that an enterprise establishes to govern access to network and connect components.
Topic / Stream-Based Security Controls: Security between topics / streams on an Event Backbone are functionally identical to API security (i.e. required “scopes” and roles).
There are several supporting capabilities for this pattern:
An Enterprise Identity Book of Record: The master repository for identity and maintains relationships to assigned groups and roles (Active directory, cloud directory, mainframe directory etc.).
A Schema / Specification Registry: Maintains “scopes” and data / event structures required to support flexible security policies for APIs and events
Governance Controls: Policies define regulatory and privacy constraints for a data product

    '''
        central_data_product_catalogue, 
        schema_manager, 
        data_product_governance
    '''
```

> The Data Mesh / Data Product Security Pattern also captures security violations at these control points and models all security violations Security Events. Since each Data Product may be implemented using different technologies, this pattern normalizes of raw security violations into consistently formatted security events.
This pattern also provides the capability to support the needs of various consumers:
Developers use this pattern to help design applications with methods of securely consuming Data Products.
Data Engineers use this pattern to build and implement secure Data Products and Data Mesh components and operating environments.
Data Scientists use this pattern to understand security credentials required to access and consume Data Products.
Security Staff use this pattern to capture and diagnose security violations to ensure an enterprise Data Mesh runs in a safe and secure manner.
Data Governance Staff use this pattern to understand usage patterns and ensure regulatory and privacy constraints are adhered to.

> How It Works
The Data Mesh / Data Product Security Pattern provides access controls to ensure Data Products are access only by authorized entities or people. It also instruments Data Products in an enterprise Data Mesh to capture and emit security violations which are transformed into “Security Events” that provide a concise and detailed security information consumable by operations and security staff.
This pattern is illustrated in three sections, each outlines key steps in a typical usage scenario describing security flows within a data product (Figure 2), between data products in a Data Mesh (Figure 3), and how different types of users interact in the Data Mesh Security Pattern (Figure 4).

![Violations](https://miro.medium.com/max/720/1*WCBtpFHic-BmrQ4H0ISjLA.webp)

> Security flows within a Data Product occurs as shown in Figure 2 (above). In step 1 and 2 a user or application generates a security violation (for example, by trying access data for which the user has insufficient privileges). In step 3 raw security events are captured and transformed into “Security Events”. These security events are then filtered and logged (step 4) and stored in an immutable change/audit log for further analysis or historical review. Each security event is subsequently made available (step 5) in a simple user interface (a “data product catalog”) that makes it easy to view security issues. Lastly, security events are also propagated via APIs or events (step 6) to allow them to be ingested in enterprise production monitoring and security solutions.

> In Figure 3 above, we can see that security violations between Data Products — for example, when a data product has insufficient permissions to add to a topic — are captured and transformed (step 7) into Security Events. As stated earlier, all data products emit security events (step 8) that occur between Data Products across the enterprise Data Mesh. Each security event is then formatted for ingestion by enterprise operations and security systems (step 9).

![Steps10-12](https://miro.medium.com/max/1100/1*i34BCypov9FmXq8YCQeBkw.webp)

> In Figure 4, above, security events are store in an Enterprise Data Product Catalog (step 10). This allows various users — developers, data scientists, and data engineers — to view security issues (step 11), while also allowing security events to be emitted to standard enterprise consoles (monitoring, operations management, and security applications.
Earlier in the article we posed several challenges that an appropriate security capability must address. Let’s revisit them to see how the Data Mesh / Data Product Security Pattern addresses them:
Unclear Access Rights: Data Mesh and Data Product security surfaces role-based-access control (RBAC) and, where needed, attribute-based-access-control in a Data Product Catalog making it easy to understand the credentials, roles, and/or permissions required to consume data.
Inconsistent Security Policies: Data Mesh and Data Product security introduces a consistent role-based-access control (RBAC) and, where needed, Attribute-based-access-control making it easy to understand the credentials, roles, and/or permissions required to consume data.
Lack of Usage Information: Data Mesh and Data Product security surfaces usage data in a Data Product Catalog as well as security access violations making it easy to govern access rights to sensitive data.
Delays in Surfacing Security Violations: Data Mesh and Data Product security captures security violations and emits them immediately to a security or operations console allowing timely diagnosis and resolution of security concerns.
Gaps in Security Context: Data Mesh and Data Product security provide rich context (who, what, when etc.) about security violations making it easy and timely to diagnosis and resolve security violations.

> Concluding Thoughts
Recent headlines have clearly shown that insecure data environment will have a catastrophic impact to an organization. By capturing security violations and immediately surfacing the security violation and its context, a comprehensive Data Mesh and Data Product security approach allows security issues to be quickly identified, diagnosed, and resolved. And by using this information, it provides the necessary insight to secure your own Enterprise Data Mesh and provide the safety needed by data-intensive organizations.
