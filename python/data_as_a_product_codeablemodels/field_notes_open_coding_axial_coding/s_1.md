> Understand with examples the similarities and differences between a “data product” and “data as a product”

> Since the publication of the data mesh introductory article by Zhamak Dehghani, there has been a lot of discussion around the definition of what is a “data product” in and outside of the data mesh context.

> By clarifying a couple of definitions in this article, we hope the concepts of “data product” and “data as a product” become clearer to anyone entering the data and data mesh worlds.

> Data products

> Let’s start with the generic definition of “data product”.

> DJ Patil, former United States Chief Data Scientist, defined a data product as “a product that facilitates an end goal through the use of data” (from his book Data Jujitsu: The Art of Turning Data into Product, 2012).

> This means that any digital product or feature can be considered a “data product” if it uses data to facilitate a goal. For example, the home page of a digital newspaper can be a data product if the news items featured in the home page I see are dynamically selected based on my previous navigation data.

**OPEN CODING TRACE:**

This is about the different types of data products that can be created. 
Important here is that a data product needs to facilitate a goal (e.g., home page of a digital newspaper)

> In 2018, Simon O’Regan published an article called Designing Data Products that lists very clear examples of data products and groups them by type: raw data, derived data, algorithms, decision support and automated decision-making.

**OPEN CODING TRACE:**

We can identify four decision option for the data product's purpose. 

Option: Raw data

Option: Derived

Option: Decision Support

Option: Automated Decision Making

``` python
raw_data_as_data_product = CClass(practice, "Expose Data Product as Raw Data")

derived_data_as_data_product = CClass(practice, "Expose Data Product as Derived Data")

automated_decision_making_model_as_data_product = CClass(practice, "Expose Data Product as Automated Decision-making Model")

data_product_type_decision = CClass(decision, "What type of data product can be developed?")

add_decision_option_link(data_product_type_decision, raw_data_as_data_product,
                         "Use raw data from the data product")

add_decision_option_link(data_product_type_decision, derived_data_as_data_product,
                         "Use derived data from the data product")                         
                         
add_decision_option_link(data_product_type_decision, decision_support_model_as_data_product,
                         "The interface to access a data product is a visualisation")

add_decision_option_link(data_product_type_decision, automated_decision_making_model_as_data_product,
                         "The interface to access a data product is an app or website")
                         
``` 


> Here is a list of example data products including the category they belong to and the interfaces used to access it:

> A company dashboard to visualise the main KPIs of your business. This data product is of the type decision support system and the interface to access it is a visualisation.

> A data warehouse. This data product is a mix of raw, derived data and decision support system. The interface to access it are probably SQL queries.

> A list of recommended restaurants nearby. Since the list is curated specifically for you, this data product is an automated decision-making one. The interface to access it is an app or website.

> A “faster route now available” notification on Google Maps is a decision support data product (as you are the one making the decision) and its interface is a web/app.

> A self-driving car is a data product too. Since it drives automatically, it is of the type automated decision-making. Its interface is, well, the car itself.

> Data as a product

> One of the principles of the data mesh paradigm is to consider data as a product. Sometimes this principle has been abbreviated to “data products”, hence the confusion.

> “Data product” is a generic concept (as explained above) and “data as a product” is a subset of all possible data products. More specifically, if we use Simon’s categories, “data as a product” belongs to the raw or derived data type of “data product”.

> If we dive in the data mesh world, this quote from Zhamak Dehghani’s original article is key to understand the definition of data as a product: “Domain data teams must apply product thinking […] to the datasets that they provide; considering their data assets as their products and the rest of the organization’s data scientists, ML and data engineers as their customers.”

> In summary, “data as a product” is the result of applying product thinking into datasets, making sure they have a series of capabilities including discoverability, security, explorability, understandability, trustworthiness, etc.

**OPEN CODING TRACE:**

Important difference is mentioned here between seeing Data-as-a-Product and a Data Product

> An example of data as a product

> So, what does data as a product look like? A data as a product contains the code, its data and metadata, and the necessary infrastructure to run it. Furthermore, it needs to fulfil the capabilities described before.

> In a talk we gave at the Data Council conference in Barcelona in 2019 titled “A Federated Information Infrastructure That Works” (video, transcript as blog post) we put an example of a dataset as a product as used in Adevinta by listing its qualities:

> Discoverable

> In order for data as a product to be discoverable, a search engine is needed and users must be able to register datasets in this engine and request access to them (this will increase security, another capability explained below).

**OPEN CODING TRACE:**

A search engine is suggested to make your datasets more discoverable. 

Option (practice): Register Datasets in an engine

Option (practice): Request access to datasets

Option (pattern): Search Engine

Force: Security

``` 

> The first iteration for this capability could be just a list of datasets in your de facto internal intranet and you can iterate and build incrementally from that. Remember that processes and culture are more important than deploying the ultimate data catalogue tool too early (which can be too complex for employees to use).

**OPEN CODING TRACE:**

Although, developing a data product catalogue is not directly mentioned as first step here, it is mentioned as a step for in the future.

```

> Addressable

> Having addressable datasets makes your teams more productive. On one side, Data Analysts and Data Scientists are autonomous in finding and using the data they need. On the other side, Data Engineers have far less interruptions from people asking where they can find data about X.

![Metadata for “data as a product” that makes the dataset addressable](https://miro.medium.com/max/720/0*7I-fbuDenA26WPeN)
> Self-describing and interoperable

> As we commented in the blog post where we explained Adevinta’s data mesh journey, datasets need to contain metadata that make them understandable and follow the same naming conventions (which will make the datasets interoperable). We found these pieces of metadata to be super useful to our Data Analysts:

> Data location (as seen above)

> Data provenance and data mapping

> Sample data

> Execution time and freshness

> Input preconditions

> Example notebook or SQL queries using the data set

**OPEN CODING TRACE:**

An example is given on how sample data can help the user understand the data product.

add_decision_option_link(keep_track_metadata_decision, query_catalogue,
                         "Provide example codes and queries to help the user understand the data")
                         
add_force_relations({query_catalogue: {trustworthiness: positive,
                                    interoperability: positive
                     })   
                     
                                           
``` 

> Trustworthy and secure

> Checking data quality regularly and automatically is a must to fulfil the trustworthy characteristic of data as a product. And owners of the datasets need to react accordingly to the results of these checks.

> Quality checks must be done at pipeline input and output and it doesn’t hurt to provide contextual data quality information to consumers of the data; like for example in Tableau dashboards.


**OPEN CODING TRACE:**

We can identify a decision option here on quality monitoring. 

Option: Provide a single integrated experience for monitoring

```

> Finally, registered data sets should not be automatically available to everyone. Employees need to request access to each one of them and data controllers need to grant or deny access individually.

> When requesting access, it is mandatory to specify until when the access is needed and for what purpose.
