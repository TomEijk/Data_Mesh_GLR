# Slide 1-35

**OPEN CODING TRACE:**
General DDD method

# Slides 36-39

**OPEN CODING TRACE:**
How bounded contexts are offered as API resources.

# Slide 39-45
**OPEN CODING TRACE:**
- Hexagonal architecture
- Link to domain events as operations between API gateway, those are the operations to be offered.
- Some smaller core subdomains are offered by boundaries for API elements as well. bounded contexts from before.

# Slide 46-50
**OPEN CODING TRACE:**
- Aggregate roots as abstractions behind domain events
- Event repository, ...
